This is THE GREAT WALL document translation project. 
This is youtube broadcast link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwXMmy5fUrVxJNVA3Vb-kRRD5l2Px21Jn
I have translated all the subtitles into finnish using self-build SRT translation tools https://huggingface.co/spaces/KarhuSuomi/srt-gemini-translation

The working process is
1. download video from youtube
2. Using CapCut/剪映 AI subtitle extraction (need SVIP function, fee-paid ), extract the srt
3. upload it to https://huggingface.co/spaces/KarhuSuomi/srt-gemini-translation, translate and download
4. combine the translated subtitle to the origin video in capcut/剪映
