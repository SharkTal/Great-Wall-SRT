## 🛠️ Workflow Overview

This project follows a structured workflow to extract, translate, and embed subtitles into videos. Here's how it works:

### 1. 📥 Download Video
Download original videos from YouTube.

### 2. 🗣️ Extract Subtitles
Use **CapCut / 剪映**'s AI subtitle extraction feature *(requires SVIP subscription)* to generate `.srt` subtitle files.

### 3. 🌐 Translate Subtitles
Upload the extracted `.srt` file to the [SRT Gemini Translation Tool on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KarhuSuomi/srt-gemini-translation), and download the translated Finnish version.

### 4. 🎥 Re-embed Subtitles
Import the translated `.srt` back into **CapCut / 剪映**, and combine it with the original video.
